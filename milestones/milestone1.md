### Project Description
Our site, LAN (Lively Adventures Nonstop) Connection, aims to bring users together in a forum discussion dedicated to discussing their adventures.
The site will have a selection of outdoor adventure categories from which a user can choose to post their thread in. Admin users will moderate the forum and have the ability to archive posts and ban/unban users.

### Project Functionality Goals

#### Minimum Functional Requirements
- 3 column layout
- Form validation with JavaScript
- Server-side scripting with PHP
- Data storage with MySQL
- Security for data
- Maintain states (users stay logged in)
- Responsive design
- Asynchronous updates
- User images and profiles stored in database
- Discussion grouping and display
- Navigation breadcrumb strategy
- Error handling
#### Additional Requirements 
- Activity by date
- search and analysis for items 
- styling flourishes (to really push the outdoor adventure theme, shouldn't be too much extra) 
- accessibility (should be able to just follow the accessibility techniques shown in class)
- tracking comment history from user perspective 
- admin view reports on usage (maybe?)
