### Project Description
Our site, LAN (Lively Adventures Nonstop) Connection, aims to bring users together in a forum discussion dedicated to discussing their adventures.
The site will have a selection of outdoor adventure categories from which a user can choose to post their thread in. Admin users will moderate the forum and have the ability to archive posts and ban/unban users.

### Project Functionality Goals

#### Baseline Objectives
- Browse discussions without registering
- Search for posts by keyword without registering
- Search for items/posts by keyword without registering

- Allow user login by providing user id and password
- Create and comment on discussions when logged into the site
- Users are required to be able to view/edit their profile
- User password recovery (via email)

#### Minimum Functional Requirements
- 3 column layout
- Form validation with JavaScript
- Server-side scripting with PHP
- Data storage with MySQL
- Security for data
- Maintain states (users stay logged in)
- Responsive design

#### Additional Requirements

- tracking comment history from user perspective 
- admin view reports on usage (maybe?)
- hot items/popular post tracking on home page
- mobile view
