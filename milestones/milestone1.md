### Project Description
Our site, LAN (Lively Adventures Nonstop) Connection, aims to bring users together in a forum discussion dedicated to discussing their adventures.
The site will have a selection of outdoor adventure categories from which a user can choose to post their thread in. Admin users will moderate the forum and have the ability to archive posts and ban/unban users.
